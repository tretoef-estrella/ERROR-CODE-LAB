abstract: >-
  A 48-hour distributed AI research campaign using four AI systems
  (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok) coordinated by a human architect
  to search for optimal linear codes over GF(2), GF(3), and GF(4).
  Results include: verified Construction XX producing [33,7,18] over GF(3)
  from BCH ingredients; Belov [32,4,21] from projective geometry PG(3,3);
  impossibility proof that [33,6,19] cannot arise as a subcode of the
  Grassl [33,7,18] via Construction XX; and empirical evidence across
  2.5M+ evaluated codes and 11 methods suggesting d_3(33,6)=18.
